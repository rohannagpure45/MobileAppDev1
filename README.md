# Unit Converter Android App

## Author

## Overview

This app is an Android app I designed for CS 4520, Mobile App Development, that converts between various units of measure (Weight, Volume, Length). It demonstrates two different architectural patterns side-by-side: **MVP** and **MVVM** within the same app. The user can navigate to either implementation from a common Home screen.

## Features
- Convert between **Kilograms and Pounds** (weight units).
- Convert between **Litres and Gallons** (volume units).
- Convert between **Yards and Meters** (length units).
- Identical user interface for both MVP and MVVM screens for consistency (input field, unit selection spinners, convert button, and result display box).
- Proper error handling for invalid inputs or incompatible unit conversions.
- Preserves the conversion result on screen during device rotation in the MVVM implementation.
